    "+One to Many relationship\n",
    "-In relational databases, a one-to-many relationship occurs when a parent record in one table can potentially reference\n",
    "several child records in another table. In a one-to-many relationship, the parent is not required to have child records; \n",
    "therefore, the one-to-many relationship allows zero child records, a single child record or multiple child records.\n",
    "The important thing is that the child cannot have more than one parent record.\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "    A Category can have multiple sub-categories\n",
    "    A Department can hold as many employees as it can\n",
    "    A Customer can have many purchase orders\n",
    "    An Order can hold multiple products\n",
    "\n",
    "+Many to Many relationship\n",
    "A many-to-many relationship refers to a relationship between tables in a database when a parent row in one table contains\n",
    "several child rows in the second table, and vice versa. Many-to-many relationships are often tricky to represent.\u000b",
    "\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "    A student can contibute to many training courses and a course can have more than one student\n",
    "    An employee can be a part of many projects and a project can have more than one employee\n",
    "\n",
    "+self-referencing relationship\n",
    "A self-referencing many-to-many relationship exists when a given record in the table can be related to one or more other records within the table and one or more records can themselves be related to the given record.\n",
    "This may sound somewhat confusing at first, but the example in Figure 10.24 should help clarify the matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "+Foreign key Constraints\n",
    "In context of relational databases, a foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table.\n",
    "In simpler words, the foreign key is defined in a second table, but it refers to the primary key in the first table.\n",
    "Foreign keys usually refer to primary keys in the parent table.\n",
    "You can create a foreign key constraint while in the CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE contentx.\n",
    "\n",
    "CONSTRAINT [symbol]] FOREIGN KEY [index_name] (index_col_name, ...) REFERENCES tbl_name (index_col_name,...) [ON DELETE reference_option] [ON UPDATE reference_option]\n",
    "\n",
    "EX: ALTER TABLE tbl_name ADD CONSTRAINT fk_something FOREIGN KEY (col_name_in_child_table) REFERENCES (col_name_in_praent_table) [reference_options]\n",
    "\n",
    "now achived :Referential Integrity\n",
    "    The technique of maintaining data always in a consistent format, part of the ACID philosophy.\n",
    "    In particular, data in different tables is kept consistent through the use of foreign key constraints,\n",
    "    which can prevent changes from happening or automatically propagate those changes to all related tables. \n",
    "    Related mechanisms include the unique constraint, which prevents duplicate values from being inserted by mistake, \n",
    "    and the NOT NULL constraint, which prevents blank values from being inserted by mistake.\n",
