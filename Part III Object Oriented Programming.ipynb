    "You’ll learn the following:\n",

    "The API that handles operators and built-ins in Python\n",
    "The “secret” behind len() and other built-ins\n",
    "How to make your classes capable of using operators\n",
    "How to make your classes compatible with Python’s built-in functions\n",
    "\n",
    "As a bonus, you’ll also see an example class, \n",
    "objects of which will be compatible with many of these operators and functions. Let’s get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Data Model\n",
    "Say you have a class representing an online order having a cart (a list) and a customer (a str or instance of another class\n",
    "which represents a customer).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you need a refresher on OOP in Python, check out this tutorial on Real Python: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) \n",
    "in Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "In such a case, it is quite natural to want to obtain the length of the cart list. \n",
    "Someone new to Python might decide to implement a method called get_cart_len() in their class to do this.\n",
    "But you can configure the built-in len() in such a way that it returns the length of the cart list when given our object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In another case, we might want to append something to the cart. Again, \n",
    "someone new to Python would think of implementing a method called append_to_cart() that takes an item and \n",
    "appends it to the cart list. But you can configure the + operator in such a way that it appends a new item to the cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does all this using special methods. These special methods have a naming convention, where the name starts with\n",
    "two underscores, followed by an identifier and ends with another pair of underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, each built-in function or operator has a special method corresponding to it. \n",
    "For example, there’s __len__(), corresponding to len(), and __add__(), corresponding to the + operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, most of the built-ins and operators will not work with objects of your classes.\n",
    "You must add the corresponding special methods in your class definition to make your object compatible with built-ins \n",
    "and operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do this, the behavior of the function or operator associated with it changes according to that defined in\n",
    "the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what the Data Model (Section 3 of the Python documentation) helps you accomplish. \n",
    "It lists all the special methods available and provides you with the means of overloading built-in functions and \n",
    "operators so that you can use them on your own objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see what this means.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Internals of Operations Like len() and []\n",
    "Every class in Python defines its own behavior for built-in functions and methods. When you pass an instance of some class to a built-in function or use an operator on the instance, it is actually equivalent to calling a special method with relevant arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a built-in function, func(), and the corresponding special method for the function is __func__(), Python interprets a call to the function as obj.__func__(), where obj is the object. In the case of operators, if you have an operator opr and the corresponding special method for it is __opr__(), Python interprets something like obj1 <opr> obj2 as obj1.__opr__(obj2).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when you’re calling len() on an object, Python handles the call as obj.__len__(). When you use the [] operator on an iterable to obtain the value at an index, Python handles it as itr.__getitem__(index), where itr is the iterable object and index is the index you want to obtain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when you define these special methods in your own class, you override the behavior of the function or operator associated with them because, behind the scenes, Python is calling your method. Let’s get a better understanding of this:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> a = 'Real Python'\n",
    ">>> b = ['Real', 'Python']\n",
    ">>> len(a)\n",
    "11\n",
    ">>> a.__len__()\n",
    "11\n",
    ">>> b[0]\n",
    "'Real'\n",
    ">>> b.__getitem__(0)\n",
    "'Real'\n",
    "As you can see, when you use the function or its corresponding special method, you get the same result. In fact, when you obtain the list of attributes and methods of a str object using dir(), you’ll see these special methods in the list in addition to the usual methods available on str objects:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> dir(a)\n",
    "['__add__',\n",
    " '__class__',\n",
    " '__contains__',\n",
    " '__delattr__',\n",
    " '__dir__',\n",
    " ...,\n",
    " '__iter__',\n",
    " '__le__',\n",
    " '__len__',\n",
    " '__lt__',\n",
    " ...,\n",
    " 'swapcase',\n",
    " 'title',\n",
    " 'translate',\n",
    " 'upper',\n",
    " 'zfill']\n",
    "If the behavior of a built-in function or operator is not defined in the class by the special method, then you will get a TypeError.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how can you use special methods in your classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Overloading Built-in Functions\n",
    "Many of the special methods defined in the Data Model can be used to change the behavior of functions such as len, abs, hash, divmod, and so on. To do this, you only need to define the corresponding special method in your class. Let’s look at a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Giving a Length to Your Objects Using len()\n",
    "To change the behavior of len(), you need to define the __len__() special method in your class. Whenever you pass an object of your class to len(), your custom definition of __len__() will be used to obtain the result. Let’s implement len() for the order class we talked about in the beginning:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> class Order:\n",
    "...     def __init__(self, cart, customer):\n",
    "...         self.cart = list(cart)\n",
    "...         self.customer = customer\n",
    "...\n",
    "...     def __len__(self):\n",
    "...         return len(self.cart)\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> order = Order(['banana', 'apple', 'mango'], 'Real Python')\n",
    ">>> len(order)\n",
    "3\n",
    "As you can see, you can now use len() to directly obtain the length of the cart. Moreover, it makes more intuitive sense to say “length of order” rather than calling something like order.get_cart_len(). Your call is both Pythonic and more intuitive. When you don’t have the __len__() method defined but still call len() on your object, you get a TypeError:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> class Order:\n",
    "...     def __init__(self, cart, customer):\n",
    "...         self.cart = list(cart)\n",
    "...         self.customer = customer\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> order = Order(['banana', 'apple', 'mango'], 'Real Python')\n",
    ">>> len(order)  # Calling len when no __len__\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "TypeError: object of type 'Order' has no len()\n",
    "But, when overloading len(), you should keep in mind that Python requires the function to return an integer. If your method were to return anything other than an integer, you would get a TypeError. This, most probably, is to keep it consistent with the fact that len() is generally used to obtain the length of a sequence, which can only be an integer:\n",
